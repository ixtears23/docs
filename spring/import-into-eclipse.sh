Spring Framework - Eclipse/STS Project Import Guide

This script will guide you through the process of importing the Spring
Framework projects into Eclipse or the Spring Tool Suite (STS). It is
recommended that you have a recent version of Eclipse or STS. As a bare
minimum you will need Eclipse with full Java 8 support, the AspectJ
Development Tools (AJDT), and the Groovy Compiler.

This script has been tested against:

- STS:     3.8.3.RELEASE (Eclipse Neon.2 4.6.2)
- AJDT:    2.2.4.201612122115 (Eclipse Neon 4.6)

If you need to download and install Eclipse or STS, please do that now
by visiting one of the following sites:

- Eclipse downloads: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads
- STS downloads: http://spring.io/tools/sts/all
- STS nightly builds: http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/STS/nightly-distributions.html
- ADJT: http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/
- Groovy Eclipse: https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki

Once Eclipse/STS is installed, press enter, and we'll begin.
